JavaScript History:***==============================================***

-> JavaScript was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995.

-> It was developed by Netscape ,and became the ECMA-262 standard in 1997

-> After Netscape handed JavaScript over to ECMA, the Mozilla foundation continued to develop JavaScript
 for the Firefox browser.

-> JavaScript was only supported by the Internet Explorer browser when it was developed.

-> In 1997, to promote JavaScript across all web browsers, Netscape submitted a proposal to the European 
 Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) for standardizing JavaScript.

-> This is how ECMAScript(ES) came into the world of development. After that, the JavaScript developer's 
 community and Netscape update the JavaScript continuously, adding new features to the JavaScript and 
 releasing the new version, ES1, ES2, …, ES13, etc.

-> The latest version of JavaScript is ES13.

What is JavaScript?***==============================================***

-> JavaScript is a lightweight programming language commonly used by web developers to add dynamic interactions
 to web pages, applications, servers, and even games.

-> It works seamlessly alongside HTML and CSS, complementing CSS in formatting HTML elements while providing user 
 interaction, a capability that CSS alone lacks.

-> JavaScript’s widespread applications in web, mobile app, and game development make it a valuable language to learn.

What Is JavaScript Used For?***==============================================***

-> JavaScript has continued to grow alongside new browsers like Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome since then. 
 The latter even started developing the first modern JavaScript engine, called V8, which compiles bytecode
 into native machine code.
 
-> JavaScript Used For Web and Mobile Apps:
 The development of JavaScript frameworks, consisting of JavaScript code libraries, allows developers to 
 use pre-written JavaScript code in their projects. It saves them time and effort from having to code
 programming features from scratch.

 Each JavaScript framework has features that aim to simplify the development and debugging process.

 For example, front-end JavaScript frameworks like jQuery and ReactJS improve design efficiency. 
 They allow developers to reuse and update code components without affecting each other, 
 function or value-wise.
 
-> JavaScript Used For Building Web Servers and Server Applications:
 Through Node.js, JavaScript lets developers build web servers and back-end infrastructure, 
 saving you time and effort in web server creation.
 
-> JavaScript Used For Interactive Behavior on Websites:
 One of JavaScript’s core functions is adding dynamicity to web pages. 
 This includes displaying animations, modifying text visibility, and creating dropdown menus.

 While you can use only HTML and CSS code to build a website, it will only have a static display. 
 With JavaScript, a user can interact with web pages and have a better browsing experience.

-> JavaScript Used For Game Development:
 JavaScript can help you build a game if used with HTML5 and an Application Programming Interface (API).
 Some of the games made with JavaScript game engines include Angry Birds, The Wizard, and 2048.

What Make's JavaScript Great ***==============================================***
 
-> JavaScript has a number of advantages that make it a better choice than its competitors. 
 The following are several benefits of using JavaScript:
 
 [1].Simplicity 
 [2].Speed 
 [3].Versatility 
 [4].Server load 
 [5].Updates 


 ***==============================================***
What Are JavaScript’s Weaknesses?***==============================================***
 
-> The following are some of the Weaknesses of using JavaScript:

 [1].Browser compatibility :
     different web browsers interpret JavaScript code differently, causing inconsistency. 
	 Therefore, you should test your JavaScript script in all popular web browsers, 
	 including their older versions, to avoid harming the user experience.
	 
 [2].Security :
     JavaScript code that runs on the client-side is vulnerable to exploitation by 
	 irresponsible users.
	 
 [3].Debugging : 
     while some HTML editors support debugging, they’re less efficient than other editors. 
	 Since browsers don’t show any warning for errors, finding the issue may be challenging.
	 
	 
 ***==============================================
How Does the JavaScript Code Work on Your Web Page?
================================================***
 
-> JavaScript is either embedded directly into a web page or referenced via a separate .js file. 
 When a user visits that web page, their browser will run the script along with the 
 HTML and CSS code ‒ creating a functional page displayed via the browser tab.
 
-> The script is downloaded to the visitors’ machines and processed there. 
 This diffrence from a server-side language, in which the server processes the script before 
 sending it to the browser.
 That called compiling.
